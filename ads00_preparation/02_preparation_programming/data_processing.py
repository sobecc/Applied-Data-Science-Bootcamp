    """
    This function takes a list of prices for a given commodity.

    The prices are given as a list of list of numbers. Each inner list corresponds
    to a day of the week, and each number corresponds to the price at a given
    hour of the day (limited to business hours only).

    See the example of PRICES_PER_HOUR_PER_DAY_SAMPLE above. Here we have a list
    containing five lists (so the data is for one week only), each inner list
    contains 8 numbers, for 8 hours in the day.

    This function should normalise all the prices such that the first value is
    worth 100 and the other are adjusted accordingly.

    E.g., normalize_prices([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) is [[100, 200], [300, 400]]
    E.g., normalize_prices([[200, 20], [30, 400]]) is [[100, 10], [15, 200]]

    NOTE: prices need to consist of lists of the same length meaning that no prices
    for given hours are missing and if they are, you must raise a ValueError.

    :return: normalised list of list of prices where the first price is 100
